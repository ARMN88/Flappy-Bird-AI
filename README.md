# Flappy-Bird-AI
An AI that leans how to play flappy bird using a neural network that learns through evolution.

## How It Works
There are 100 birds to start, each have a neural network that is inputted the 
vertical distance to the top pipe, vertical distance to the bottom pipe, 
horizontal distance to the pipe, and the bird's velocity. At first, the 
neural networks do random things, but after all the birds die, they crossover
to create the new generation. There is also a 1% mutation rate. Eventually, they
will learn how to play the game.
